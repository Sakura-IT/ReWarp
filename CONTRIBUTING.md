## Reporting bugs and issues

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Sakura-IT/ReWarp/issues) to track problems.

When creting a new issue, please include the following information:
* ReWarp build number, or if you built the source yourself, date of the source snapshot.
* Exact AmigaOS version (for example "AmigaOS 4.1 Update 6").
* CPU model (for example "PowerPC 460").
* Graphics card model (for example "Radeon HD 7750").
* If the software uses Warp3D: 
  * Which Warp3D implementation did you use (Warp3D, Wazp3D), please also report the exact version.
  * Whether any Warp3D patch was used, like PatchWarp3D.

## Sending patches 

All code fixes are welcome. GitHub is just a mirror of the development repository. Therefore, please do not use pull requests on GitHub, we can not merge them automatically. Instead just attach an unified diff to the issue (alternatively, upload the diff to gist, link the gist in an issue).
