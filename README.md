ReWarp
======

This project is a reimplementation of WarpOS for AmigaOS 4 (work in progress).
It's aim is to support all the current flavors of machines running AmigaOS 4 including the X5000.
At this moment 90% of all WarpOS functions are implemented.

# Note about Warp3D

For the time being, use the warp3dPPC.library from the old warposemu for Warp3D support.
If that does not work, try first with wazp3D to confirm it is not ReWarp which is causing the problem.
Alain Thellier's patchwarp3d (found on Aminet) also fixes a lot of lockups and artifacts with Voodoo and Radeon R200.
