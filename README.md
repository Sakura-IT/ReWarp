ReWarp
======

This project is a reimplementation of WarpOS for AmigaOS 4 (work in progress).
It's aim is to support all the current flavors of machines running AmigaOS 4 including the X5000.
At this moment 95% of all WarpOS functions are implemented.

# Note about Warp3D

A new implementation of Warp3DPPC can be found at https://github.com/Sakura-IT/ReWarp3DPPC .
If it fails, try first with Wazp3D from Alain Thellier to confirm it is not ReWarp which is causing the problem.
Alain Thellier's PatchWarp3D also fixes a lot of lockups and artifacts with Voodoo and Radeon R200.
Both can be found on Aminet.
